# WRTDSplus Validation Report

## Methodology
Synthetic data where Conc depends on Discharge (Q) and Temperature. Comparison of standard model (Q only) vs WRTDSplus (Q + Temp).

## Results
| Model | RMSE (Log) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Standard WRTDS | 0.1435 |
| WRTDSplus | 0.1038 |

**Conclusion:** SUCCESS. WRTDSplus improved prediction by leveraging Temperature.
